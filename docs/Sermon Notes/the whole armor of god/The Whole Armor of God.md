## Summary

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer
> The following sermon introduction is taken from Gospel In Life, and is not my own original note. 

What are we supposed to do so we don’t lead defeated lives?

[[Ephesians]] 6 tells us about spiritual warfare, about the problems that get thrown at us. And it also tells us about our arsenal, the full armor of God. We’re now going to look not so much at what is being thrown at us, but at what we can do to respond to it, how we can defend ourselves. 

We’re beginning a series on the full armor of God, looking at 1) what is is and 2) how to put it on.

This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 19, 1992. Series: Spiritual Warfare – The Armor of God. Scripture: Ephesians 6:10-18.
