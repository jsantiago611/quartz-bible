â€¦because evil is multi-dimensional. 
- B.F. Skinner and the behaviorist psychologists say that **the world** and our environment makes us who we are and explains our problems. 
- Biological Determinists say it's **the flesh**, or your genes, that make you who you are. Existential and humanist psychologists say it's our choices that make us who we are.
- Superstitious Pagans said it was the spirits that caused the evil and problems of life. 

The Bible however, says (in [[Ephesians]])... that it's all 3! 

Christianity has the most nuanced, complete view of evil:
- There's inside me. 
- There's evil outside me. 
- There's evil above me. 

Unless you know how to deal with this evil, you'll live a defeated life. Therefore, you have to put on the armor of God. Because Evil is multi-dimensional and it hits you from every direction.
