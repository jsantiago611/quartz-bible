title: Father, Son and Holy Spirit

### Sermon Summary

If God was unipersonal, there would have been no love until he created the world. However, if the world was created by a triune God, then relationships of love are what life is all about. The Godhead is characterized by mutual self-giving love as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit orbit around each other in a dance ([[Ultimate Reality is a Dance]]). [[The greatest need in your life is to enter into that dance]]. It is impossible for us to join in if we focus on ourselves, but through Jesus Christ and his sacrificial death on the cross, [[Through Jesus Christ and his sacrificial death on the cross, We can be brought into the dance]].

### Prayer
Thank you, Father, for this cosmic vision of who you are and what you have called us to be and what the universe is really about. 

We are so grateful that this means that if we embrace you, in the future, there is going to be joy. This world is heading for a party, a feast, for love, for joy, for fellowship. We are not going to someday lose our individuality and drop off into an impersonal all-soul, we're not going to rot and go to nothing. 

We are bound for this:  The interior life of the triune God, and we thank you for that and we ask that you would help us live in accordance with this ultimate reality. 

In Jesus Name, Amen.
