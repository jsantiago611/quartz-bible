In general... no. 

Instead, It sets up a slippery slope. 

It makes you feel that you have a corner on the truth... 
which makes you feel superior... 
which leads you to spending less time with others that don't believe what you do... 
which leads to you thinking of them as less important... 
which eventually leads you to justifying even their oppression and harm.

So how do we handle it?

Religion will not fade away. 
Religion cannot be banned or controlled. 
Religion cannot be privatized. 
Take a closer look at Christianity.
