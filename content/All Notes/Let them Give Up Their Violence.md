### Point 1: The surprising sources of violence. 
- The first source of violence in this text is the pagan (the word "pagan", btw, is not meant as immoral, but as a polytheistic ancient culture ).
- These cultures were extremely violent. Why? St. Augustine breaks it down in his book "City of God" (which made polytheism intellectually untenable for centuries after its authorship) where he gives 2 major reasons why polytheists were so violent: 
	- 1. These ancient polytheistic cultures believed the universe was essentially violent and chaotic. In contrast, theists who believe in God, view the world as an orderly place that was created by an orderly and intelligent being. 
	- 2. They had no bases for justice and 
- The point? Polytheism tends to violence.

#### Pluralistic Relativism is a source of oppression, abuse of power, and violence. 

In the  first point of the Sermon, "Let them Give Up Their Violence", Keller makes an pretty astute comparison between the people of Ninevah (the Ancient Pluralist Relativists) and Jonah (the Moral Absolutelist). The Ninevites were blood-thirsty ancient polytheists, and Jonah was a religious, morally upright preacher.

#### Religion, if not set within the context of grace, is also a source of oppression, abuse of power, and violence.

| How it's a source of violence | Jonah is violently angery because he's religious. He's angry that God is not acting on the "wicked people". If morality is not put into the context of grace, it becomes moralism...which has the seeds for oppression, abuses of power, and violence. <br><br>Nietzsche points out that the violence against Jesus comes from the religious people! This means that almost every human has potential for violence. <br><br><br> |

Surprisingly, *both* Pluralistic Relativism and Moral Absolutism are the seeds for oppression, abuses of power, and violence.
