title: The greatest need in your life is to enter into that dance
---
*I once put ministry work over the relationships of my own family.*

The moment where I was "dashed against the rocks of reality" was a moment where my wife told me she felt like a single parent. That I was out teaching and caring for other parent's kids, but wasn't even home to see my own growing up quicker than I could keep up. That night, I felt betrayed by those stinging words, arguing back that I wasn't out doing anything morally wrong. But she was right.

And when I dialed back the meetings and sermon prep and building clean-up, I realized that i was missing out on the most important relationships in my life.
## If this world is made by a triune God (see the [[Trinity]]), then relationships of love are what your life is really all about. 

If there is no God, that means that what we call love is just a chemical condition of the brain. Everything that is here is just to pass on genetic love, and if you feel love, it's really just because it enables you to survive and get your body parts to the right places to pass on your genetic code. But if God is triune... ultimate reality is a community of persons knowing and loving one another. 

Why enter the dance?
### Reason #1: Because you'll come up empty in life if you live for anything else.

If you put any of this above love, you will dash yourself on the rocks of reality, because love is ultimate reality. You'll come up empty in life. You were made for mutual self-giving love, not self-centeredness. 

Money, Accomplishments, Career, Great family life, Investments will compete for first place in your life. 

But unless you are willing to experience...
- the loss of options, 
- the surrender, 
- the limitation that comes from being in deep committed relationships, 
- the loss of money
- the loss of time
- the career you'll never have...
Unless you put relationships first, you'll be dashed on the rocks of reality. 
### Reason #2: Because you were made to enter the dance.

Not just to believe in Him in some general way, or just to be spiritual in some general way, not just to get some inspiration or pray when things are tough, or just have a cognitive belief. 

You were made to center everything around God. To think of everything in terms of a relationship with Him. That's what we were made for.

> Or do you just believe in God? or do you just pray to him when you are in trouble?
> Don't be afraid. Accept the invitation to the dance and orbit around him.

How do you get in the dance? Through Jesus.
