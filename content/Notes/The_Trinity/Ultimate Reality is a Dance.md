### Mark describes God as a 3-person [[Trinity]]

In Mark 1, the Holy Spirit is likened to a dove. 
- That is common to us today, but in Judaism, only 1 place where that happens...
- Which is In Genesis 1:1-2, the Hebrew verb is "flutter". 
- More specific, the translation reads "the spirit of God fluttered over the face of the deep like a dove."

In that original CREATION account, you have 3 parties in creation: 
1. God
2. God's spirit
3. God's Word

In Mark's RE-CREATION account of the world, we also have *those same parties*. 

This is describing a [[Trinity]]. What is the implication of believing in a trinitarian God? If this world has been created in the image of Triune God, then ultimate reality is a dance. 
### This Trinity Dances
Here is the dance: 
- "When Jesus comes out of the water, the FATHER envelopes him and covers him with words of love. "("You are my son whom I love")
- â€¦ and the Spirit envelops Him with power.

When we notice the dance...we are looking into:
- The heart of reality
- The meaning of live
- the essence of the universe

What does this mean that the trinity dances?

> In Christianity, God is not an impersonal thing, or a static thing. He's not even just one person, but a dynamic pulsating activity. A life. A Drama, almost, if you think me not irreverent, a kind of dance... so what does it all matter? Almost more than anything else in the whole world. For the whole dance or drama or pattern of this 3-personal life is to be played out in each of us. They are the great fountain of energy and beauty spurning up at the very center of reality and there is no other way to the happiness for which we have been made.

> The Bible says that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit Glorify one another. That means the persons within God exalt, commune with, and defer to one another. Each harbors the other at the center of its being. In constant movement of overture and acceptance, each person envelops and encircles the other. God's interior life therefore, overflows with self-giving love for others. 

### The "Dance" is really an graphical representation for their self-giving nature

*Why do they talk about a dance?* 

Well, to depict selfishness graphically, selfishness is stationary. 

A self-centered life...
- ... is a stationary life. 
- ... is a static life. 
- ... is a self-centered life wants everyone to orbit around you. For example...a selfish person may give to the poor, as long as it doesn't cut too much into your life style, and makes you feel good about yourself. 
- ... makes everything else a means to an end
- ... is non-negotiable about one thing: "My interests over theirs"

The Godhead, is the opposite, characterized by **mutually self-giving love**: 
- Each person does *not* insist that any of the others revolve around the other
- They center on one another. 
- They glorify one another.
- They adore one another.
- They serve one another.
- They defer to one another.
- They put interests of others above their own
- They voluntarily orbits around the others. 

It's a dynamic, pulsating dance of joy. 

What are the implications of this? The biggest one is that [[The greatest need in your life is to enter into that dance]].
