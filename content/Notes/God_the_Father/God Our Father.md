### Introduction
1. In summer blockbuster movies, the characters are intentionally one-dimensional, so that when they get blown away, we just applaud the special effects. 
2. Most people have that same one-dimensional view of God. He is either: 
	- The great force of energy
	- benevolent grandpa
	- stern judge
	- wonderful loving friend
	- unmoved mover
3. But God is complex. He's a father *and* a friend *and* a judge, *and* all these things. When you become a Christian, He becomes all these things to you.
4. It's knowing one of these aspects/images that will heal you in some way. This note details the view of God as Father. 

### First, What does it mean that God is a father?

**Absolute Safety**
- vs. 13-14. 13 shows us the deep emotion God has for us, and 14 shows us why.
- First, Notice the deep emotion of God for us
	- Explanation of the word Compassion = to be overwhelmingly, viscerally in love with something. Used in Isaiah 49:15 (God here is identifying with the biologically rooted overwhelming love that a mother has for her infant as her milk is coming in) and 1 Kings 3:26 (sacrificial love where she is willing to give her life to save the child)
	- Objection: ""
- Second, But *why* does God love us?
	- Not because we fear Him
	- But *Because* we are falling apart, broken, fallen, sinful (dust is a metaphor)
	- Illustration in parenting: Whatever you do, you are safe in his insolvable emotional commitment. 
		- Friends have to stop being friends if the other person is not being a friend
		- Lovers have to stop being lovers if the other person is not reciprocating that love
		- Kings cannot be in a good relationship with citizens that are trampling on their laws
		- But a Father is always there. The more rebellious the child, the more intense the love. Your heart goes out more, and your heart will always love. 
	- Humans are like this because we are made in his image, and HE is like this. 
	- His children are absolutely safe in his love. 
	- We can only get this from God as Father. Even human parents are dust. 

**Compassionate Anger**
- vs. 8-10
- Insight 1: God's anger is not a "payback" anger that requites us for our sins. 
- Insight 2: However, God is a God that *does* get angry. 
- Permissive parents ("no anger") destroy. Abusive parents ("payback anger") destroys. God is neither. 
- Pippert quote. 
- More comparisons between human flawed parenting anger and God's anger. 
- We need compassionate anger. 

**Ultimate Home**
- verse 15
### Second, How should we respond?
